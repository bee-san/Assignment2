get_series is essential for parts 1 and 2
take 10 (get_series 0)
gives you the first 10 days of financial data from asset #0

short_data gets you the first 10 days of all financial data combinded

you have to change the strings so that they point to the right place in the terminal

part a - map and filter

part b - fold scanl

part c- use whatever you want, but try to use a fold and scan as it might be easier

john walks us through this quite slowly

Question 1.

To convert a price from one currency to another, we multiply the price by an exchange

rate.  So if the price is

2.0

in currency A, and the exchange rate between currency A and currency B is
1.31, then the price in currency B is

2.0 * 1.31 = 2.62


Write a function

convert_single :: [Float] -> Float -> [Float]

that converts a price series

into another currency.  The first argument is a price series,  and the second argument is the exchange

rate.  For example:

ghci> convert_single (get_short_series 0) 2.0

[76.72,76.8,75.6,73.68,75.04,77.28,72.96,73.44,75.28,75.04]

Your implementation should use the map function.
